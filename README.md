# ai
this project is about self study for AI tech.

AI IS A VERY COMPLICATED COMPLEX.

and it's hard for a beginner to touch its great power.
by starting from one fanstatic thing of using it can make a difference ,and can get myself pumped about this technlogy.
so  this resp only foucus on next topic ,algrothims and tools.


## topic

prediction
human mankinds persue the predictiton ability since ancient times, this topic is intresting and exciting.And AI tech certaintly can support this  kind of dream.
  
## algrothims

linear regression  
regression tree  
nearest-neighbor  
算法入门【好】：https://github.com/yanzmgit/code


## tools

python  
facebook prophet  
tensorflow  
keras  



## future

in the future, we can use meachine tech and deep tech to improve our task.   
always remerber they are ways, not the aims.  
for instance, simple example like https://blog.csdn.net/Suyebiubiu/article/details/79978996   
and we need to study the Andrew Ng's  course.


## why not other directions

speech recognition、picture recognition、 natural language processing(NPL)、auto drive、robot control technology and so on.
those direction are beyond my ability to understand ,to learn and to master it.
